# Overview

Usability tests are a fundamental part of any UX designer's tool kit. They're my favorite part of the job and always yield extraordinary insights for minimal cost. Usability tests can identify problems with onboarding new users, identify pain points for current users, and be used as a rubric to ensure new features and updates truly improve the user experience.

I worked with Wegmans Rx team to perform usability tests on the web portal of Wegmans Pharmacy. This project was conducted along with my classmates for the course of Usability Testing at RIT.

The portal provides services such as prescription refills, prescription transfer to Wegmans Pharmacy, prescription management for family members and pets, refill reminders and reminders to take medication.
